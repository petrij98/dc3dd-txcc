2011-03-02 Richard Cordovano <rcordovano@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added the ability to specify log= and hlog= more than once.
	* Added phod= and fhod= options. For an output that is a device, using phod= ("partially hashed output device")
        causes dc3dd to compute hashes of only the bytes dc3dd wrote to the output device. If fhod= 
        ("fully hashed output device") is specified instead, dc3dd will compute hashes of both the bytes dc3dd wrote 
        and of the entire device. 

2009-08-28 Richard Cordovano <rcordovano@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Replaced the byte-by-byte verification capability with a verification capability that
     hashes imaging outputs and compares the hashes to the input hash. The new verification capability
     does not require a second read of the device.
	* Enhanced the ability to generate multiple outputs by adding the capability to combine split and unsplit
     outputs.
	* Added the ability for the user to specify a sector size via the command line.
	* Added display/logging of results of device size probes. Size probes are now always performed, providing
     run statistics in most use cases (reading from standard input excepted). 
	* Added display/logging of size statistics for each file in an input or output split.
	* Simplified the command line options and removed all legacy dd features not needed for imaging. The simplified
     command line is more rigorously validated to reduce the likelihood of performing a run contrary to user 
     intent in order to avoid a second read of a device.
	* Removed the progress=on command line option and the cumbersome INFO signaling protocol for 
     obtaining a progress report. Instead, a progress bar is always displayed.
	* Added new DEFAULT_IMAGING_MODE compile flag support (equivalent to command line options:
     recovererrs=on, grouperrs=on, idirect=on).
	* Reduced the use of global variables from 71 to 9, reduced function lengths, and
     removed several instances of code duplication. 
	* Introduced a program architecture that replaces a single loop with a jobs abstraction, allowing execution
     of an arbitrary chain of jobs, each composed of one or more tasks that execute in parallel. The new
     program architecture is designed to allow for the transparent addition of multi-step processing
     scenarios such as the new verification capability.      
	         

2009-05-11 Richard Cordovano <rcordovano@users.sourceforge.net>

     * Added ability to generate multiple outputs simultaneously by supporting multiple
       of, vf, and vfjoin command line arguments.

2009-04-01 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Put hashing and disk I/O into dedicated threads to increase
	  throughput.

	  As a side effect, removed cbs and conv=ascii/ebcdic/ibm/(un)block/lcase/swab
	  command-line options since they don't apply to the goal of disk imaging.

	  Also removed hashconv option and set behavior to hashconv=after.


2009-03-24 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added ability to detect HPA / DCO hidden areas on ATA drives (Linux only)


2009-03-16 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix hashwindow - result buffer was too small, causing incorrect
	  output on OS X


2009-03-10 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix blockbench.pl to automatically work on Mac OS X


2009-02-02 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Print hashes to console when log is enabled


2008-12-15 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

2008-10-27 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed a bug that was causing incorrect hashes to be displayed when
	  using ifjoin or reading from standard input. Output data file was
	  not affected.


2008-10-15 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added wipe= to automatically wipe a device with zeros

	* Fix --help formatting so man page gets formatted properly


2008-10-06 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix minor warnings: use correct types and printf formats


2008-09-30 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	*  Add Cygwin support


2008-09-29 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix a crash when invalid ifjoin/vfjoin patterns given 

	* Fix error reporting to account for skip= offset when
	  conv=sync,noerror not used.

	* Refactor redundant code into functions

	* Remove obsolete code


2008-09-25 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix a crash when seek=X option was used without conv=notrunc


2008-09-11 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

2008-09-05 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Removed unused coreutils modules to fix static linking error on Solaris 9


2008-09-04 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated base package to Coreutils version 6.12.


2008-08-19 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Check that split size is a multiple of block size and print an
	  error message at startup, instead of mysteriously failing during
	  the run.

	* Added "blockbench" script to easily test many block sizes and find
	  the fastest option for imaging.


2008-07-24 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added ifjoin= and vfjoin= to input or verify against
	  split files


2008-06-30 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* In closing log message, indicate if process was aborted, terminated
	  normally, or terminated due to errors.


2008-06-27 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Print hash values so far when process is interrupted


2008-06-26 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Change count, skip, and seek options to take sector counts
	  instead of bytes


2008-06-24 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Report sector address when errors occur in non-grouped mode


2008-06-23 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fix compile-flag printer to handle DEFAULT_SIZEPROBE


2008-06-19 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Enable dynamic error recovery automatically when conv=sync,noerror
	  is specified

	* Probe device sector size instead of hard-coding dynamic error
	  recovery read size

	* Change default block size to 32K

	* Report progress and error positions in sectors (probed from device
	  size) instead of blocks

	* Fix error counting in dynamic error recovery mode


2008-06-17 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Log compile-time flags to the log file


2008-06-16 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Add "dynamic" block size mode for better error recovery.
	  Now when errors are detected, dc3dd rereads the failed block
	  one sector at a time. This lets users run dc3dd in a faster
	  large-block mode without losing entire blocks of data when a
	  bad sector is encountered.

	* When verifying an image, say "X bytes compared" in progress line
	  instead of "X bytes copied".


2008-06-12 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* When count is specified, calculate completion percentage
	  out of count*ibs, instead of total device size.


2008-06-11 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* When writing a pattern, sizeprobe destination device for
	  progress reporting.


2008-06-10 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added --flags command line option to display the binary's
	  configure flags


2008-06-05 Andrew Medico <amedico@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed wording of error log when I/O errors are detected
	  in errors=group mode

	* Save command-line string to log file

	* Log start and end times to log file

	* Flush log file so it gets written to disk even if the process
	  is interrupted


2008-02-29 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed default hashing support when a hash log is not
	  explicitly defined. For example, if the user configures
	  the program with CFLAGS="-DDEFAULT_HASH_MD5" but doesn't
	  specify a hash log, the hashes are now sent to stderr.


2008-02-12 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed progresscount default. I had included an extra
	  underscore yesterday.

	* Added ability to change DEFAULT_BLOCKSIZE as promised
	  in the documentation.
	

2008-02-11 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added DEFAULT_ values for some command line flags. These
	  values should be passed in the configure CFLAGS options. 
	  The specific values that can be passed:
	    - DEFAULT_HASH_MD5, DEFAULT_HASH_SHA1, DEFAULT_HASH_SHA256,
	      DEFAULT_HASH_SHA512 enable hashing algorithms
	    - DEFAULT_HASHCONV_BEFORE sets hashconv=before and
	      DEFAULT_HASHCONV_AFTER sets hashconv=after
	    - DEFAULT_PROGRESS sets progress=on
	    - DEFAULT_PROGRESSCOUNT sets progresscount=x
	      (e.g. -DDEFAULT_PROGRESSCOUNT=1000000)
	    - DEFAULT_SIZEPROBE sets sizeprobe=on

	  Example:
	  ./configure CFLAGS="-O2 -DDEFAULT_HASH_MD5 -DDEFAULT_HASH_SHA1"

	  It should be noted that any default hashing algorithms are
	  ignored if the user specifies a value for hash= on the command
	  line. Note that when a default hashing algorithm is specified
	  the program CANNOT be run without hashing enabled.

	  All other values can be overrideen normally on the command line.

	* Moved \r out of translated text in progress meter display.
	  This should help us avoid ugly errors regarding having \r in there.

	
2008-02-07 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated base package to Coreutils version 6.10.
	

2008-01-29 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed error handling such that on a partial read
	  the entire block is wiped with zeros. See bug 1881387.
	
	* Grouped errors now display the block numbers where
	  the error occured, not the offset. See bug 1881383.

	* Improved help message for splitformat option.

	
2008-01-19 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated documentation to reflect log appends, legal
	  values for hashconv
	

2008-01-12 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated contact address to dc3dd@dc3.mil.
	

2008-01-10 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Changed log files to append messages rather than overwrite.
	

2008-01-09 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Updated dc3_error_tail to create copies of the args
	  passed in just in case they need to be written twice
	  (stderr and log file).
	
	* Added check to display grouped errors at end of input
	
	
2007-12-22 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Fixed sizeprobe code for OS X. It will still need work
	  for BSD and other non-Linux, non-Mac platforms.

	
2007-12-21 Jesse Kornblum <jessekornblum@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Created new source code tree based on slimmed down version
	  of GNU Coreutils suite. Replaced existing ChangeLogs with
	  this one. This file will be for changes to the dc3dd suite.

	* Replaced NEWS file with news for dc3dd only

	* Stripped out unused programs from src and man directories

	* Cleaned top level Makefile.am and configure.ac to exclude
	  deleted programs.

	* Edited man/Makefile.am to only handle dc3dd.1 

	* Removed old directory and changelogs from coreutils
